# Velio Assessment

## Set up

Requires Pipenv to be installed.

Python and Front end are in separate directories.

cd python
pipenv install
pipenv run python youtube_data_ingestion.py

cd velio-assessment
npm install
npm run dev

## Known issues
I would definitely use .env in a production environment, however for time purposes I have it in the code.
